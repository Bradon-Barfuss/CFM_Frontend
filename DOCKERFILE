# Step 1: Use Node.js to build the React app
FROM node:16-alpine as build

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy all project files
COPY . .

# Build the React app

# Step 2: Use NGINX to serve the static files
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build files from the previous stage
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose the default NGINX port
EXPOSE 80

# Start NGINX
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
